# Pricing Research Guide — Set Competitive Fiverr Prices

This guide helps you research competitor pricing and set profitable rates for your 6 projects.

---

## 🎯 Pricing Strategy Overview

### Key Principles
1. **Don't Underprice**: You offer premium quality (tests, docs, Docker)
2. **Be Competitive**: Research top sellers in each category
3. **Tiered Value**: Basic/Standard/Premium with clear differentiation
4. **Upsell Add-ons**: Extra revenue from deployment, training, customization
5. **Location Aware**: US/EU buyers pay more than Asia

### Your Advantages (Justify Higher Pricing)
- ⚡ **<1 Hour Response** (most sellers: 6-24 hours)
- ✅ **Production-Ready Code** (most sellers: prototypes)
- 🧪 **Tests Included** (most sellers: none)
- 🐳 **Docker Configs** (most sellers: none)
- 📘 **Comprehensive Docs** (most sellers: minimal)
- ♿ **WCAG 2.1 AA** (most sellers: ignore accessibility)
- 🛡️ **Platform Protection** (highlight Fiverr escrow)
