## For You (Seller)

### Handling Difficult Questions

**Q: Can you do it for $XX (way below your price)?**  
A: 
```
I understand budget is important. However, my pricing reflects:
- Production-ready code with tests (not prototypes)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Docker deployment configs
- Post-delivery support (7-30 days)
- <1 hour response time

For $XX, I can offer [reduced scope version], or we can explore Basic package which includes [list features].

Let me know what's most important to you and I'll see how I can help within your budget.
```

**Q: Can you deliver in 1 day?**  
A:
```
For quality delivery with tests and documentation, my standard timeline is 3-14 days depending on package.

However, I do offer rush delivery as an add-on:
- 2-day delivery: +50% of package price
- 1-day delivery: +100% of package price (Basic package only, simple projects)

This ensures I can maintain quality while meeting your urgent deadline.

What's your absolute deadline? I'll let you know if it's feasible.
```

**Q: Why so expensive compared to [other seller]?**  
A:
```
Great question! Here's what you get with me that you won't find with most sellers:

✅ Production-ready code (not prototypes)
✅ Automated tests (most sellers don't include)
✅ Docker deployment configs
✅ Comprehensive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
✅ <1 hour response time (vs 6-24 hours average)
✅ Post-delivery support (7-30 days based on tier)
✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
✅ Clear milestones and progress updates

Many buyers come to me after bad experiences with cheaper sellers. I focus on quality, not volume.

That said, I'm open to discussing which package best fits your budget and requirements.
```

**Q: Can you start before I order?**  
A:
```
I appreciate your interest! However, Fiverr's policy requires an active order before I begin work.

What I can do:
1. Answer all your questions now (free)
2. Review your requirements and provide detailed estimate (free)
3. Send a custom offer with exact scope and timeline
4. You order → I start immediately

This protects both of us and ensures we're aligned on expectations.

Ready to proceed? I can send a custom offer now.
