## 🎓 Gig Optimization Tips

### Title Optimization
✅ **Good**: "Build E-commerce Price Monitoring with Playwright & Alerts (3-14 days)"  
- Includes: What (Price Monitoring), How (Playwright), Benefit (Alerts), Timeline (3-14 days)

❌ **Bad**: "I will build you a Python app"  
- Too vague, no keywords, no timeline

### Description Optimization
**Structure**:
1. Hook (pain point)
2. Solution (what you'll build)
3. Features (bullet list)
4. Tech stack
5. Why choose me
6. Process
7. FAQ
8. CTA

**Length**: 800-1200 words (detailed but scannable)

### Gallery Optimization
- **1st image**: Hero shot (most important for clicks)
- **2nd image**: Key feature highlight
- **3rd image**: Another feature or workflow
- **4th-5th images**: Tech stack, testimonials, or process
- **GIF**: Show complete workflow

### Tag Optimization
Choose tags that:
- Buyers actually search for
- Match your core skills
- Aren't overly competitive
- Describe the deliverable, not just tech

## 🐛 Common Publishing Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistakes
1. **Vague gig titles**: "I will build you a website"
2. **No screenshots**: Text-only gigs get <10% clicks
3. **Overpricing**: $500 for what others charge $200
4. **Underpricing**: $50 for what should be $500
5. **No FAQ**: Buyers have questions, answer them upfront
6. **No requirements**: You need info from buyers to start
7. **Too many revisions**: "Unlimited revisions" = scope creep
8. **Unrealistic delivery**: Promising 1 day for complex projects
9. **Copy-paste descriptions**: Generic descriptions don't convert
10. **No differentiation**: What makes you different from 1000 other devs?

### ✅ Best Practices
1. **Specific titles**: Include keywords, tech stack, timeline
2. **Professional screenshots**: Clean, high-res, annotated
3. **Market-based pricing**: Research first, adjust later
4. **Clear packages**: Obvious value progression Basic → Premium
5. **Comprehensive FAQ**: Answer objections before they ask
6. **Detailed requirements**: Know what you need upfront
7. **Limited revisions**: Scope protection (1-3 based on tier)
8. **Realistic timelines**: Under-promise, over-deliver
9. **Custom descriptions**: Tailored to each project
10. **Clear USP**: Fast response, quality code, platform protection
